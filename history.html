                                    On May 25 1992, twenty men gathered in the house of farmer Antti Partanen. The
                                    purpose ofthe meeting was to hold a founding meeting of the Kauskila, Annikkala
                                    andHyypiälä firefighters.
                                    Less than a year later, on April 2, 1923, it was decided unanimously to
                                    acquire a house for the fire brigade. The house was traded by Russian
                                    emigrants.
                                    Väinö Oikkonen was elected the first head of the fire brigade and Emil Karhu the
                                    head of the rescue department. Juho Vainikka was elected head of the fire
                                    department.

                                    The house was built with helpers, with the idea of ​​tiny dances in
                                    The inauguration of the house was considered customary in 1923. After

                                    help of
                                    villagers.
                                    As a bright spot in the midst of economic distress, the municipality of
                                    Lappeenranta offered the fire brigade the municipality's first fire truck.
